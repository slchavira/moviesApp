# Movies App!

Build an application that uses jQuery to do the following:

- Contains a form with two inputs for a title and rating along with a button to submit the form.
- When the form is submitted, capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.
- When the button to remove is clicked, remove each title and rating from the DOM.

## Further Study

- Ensure that the rating of a movie can only be between 0 and 10.
- Ensure that a title has at least 2 characters in it.
- Allow users to sort alphabetically by the title of the movie or by the rating of the movie from lowest to highest and vice versa.
